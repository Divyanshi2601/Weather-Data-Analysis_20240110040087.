Weather Data Analysis

Overview
This project provides a Python script to analyze and visualize weather data, including temperature trends, rainfall patterns, and seasonal variations using *Pandas, **Matplotlib, and **Seaborn*.

Features
- *Temperature Trends*: A line chart to visualize temperature changes over time.
- *Rainfall Analysis*: A bar chart showing rainfall distribution.
- *Seasonal Weather Patterns*: A box plot to explore seasonal variations in weather data.

Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn


Usage
1. Clone the repository:
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-data-analysis.git
cd weather-data-analysis

2. Run the script:
bash
python weather_analysis.py


## Sample Data Structure
The script uses a small weather dataset structured as follows:
python
{
    'Date': ['2023-01-01', '2023-02-01', ...],
    'Temperature': [15, 18, 20, ...],
    'Rainfall': [30, 45, 20, ...],
    'Season': ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', ...]
}


Replace it with actual weather data for real analysis.

Output
- *Line plot* for temperature trends.
- *Bar chart* for rainfall analysis.
- *Box plot* for seasonal weather variations.
